Data Structure Study.

Demo for the two data structures in the XMC Lib:

The XMC_LIST_t and XMC_PRIOARRAY_t defined in the xmc_common.h are not for user code.

Because the node structure does not contain value.It seems the official team plan to use these structures only inside the library.

This demo provides an implementation based on the reference code.

Half complete.
