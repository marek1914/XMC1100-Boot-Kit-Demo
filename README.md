Data Structure Study.

Demo for Single Linked List:

The XMC_LIST_t is defined in the xmc_common.h which is not for user code.

Because the node structure does not contain value.It seems the official team plan to use it only inside the library.

This demo provides an implementation based on the reference code.

Other structure will be implemented in the future.
